# Setup
1. Before cloning, run `pre_setup.sh` in the parent directory. You won't actually have this file so you can download it separately or just run the commands within.
2. Once you have the project and have done everything in `pre_setup.sh`, from within the project directory run `sh bootstrap.sh`
3. `bower serve` should launch a server and browser window with the project if everything is set up appropriately
